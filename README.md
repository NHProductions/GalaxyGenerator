# GalaxyGenerator
Generates realistic looking galaxies in PHP.


## Mathematics:
So, this galaxy generator actually has quite a bit of math, so basically, galaxy spirals can be represented by using logarithmic spirals 
r = r<sub>0</sub>e<sup>kθ</sup>, where r<sub>0</sub>, e and k are constants, and theta is a variable that can be used to generate the spirals.
Then, stars on the spirals are generated by using gaussian noise (Meaning most stars are clustered near the spiral, and some aren't).

For the actual stars, they're split into 3 regions; the bulge (extremely near the center), middle (between the bulge and the start of the spirals), and the spirals. The density of these regions can be changed by the user.
